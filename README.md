# F1-Database
Formula 1 is one of the most popular and technologically advanced sports in the world.
It is the pinnacle of motorsport/automobile technology. It is the biggest and highest degree of international racing for single-seater formula racing cars.
Grand Prix is a race that is conducted all over the globe. A Grand Prix race week comprises a practice day, qualifying race day, and final race day.Together
all these races are called the F1 season, governed and sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l’Automobile (FIA).In the race, FIA evaluates the
performance of the driver and the constructor. A constructor is a group of people who design the key components of the car. At the end of a season, the FIA
combines the scores made by each and awards two annual World Championships: F1 Driver Championship and Constructor Championship. Formula1 cars consist of
various mechanical, electrical, electronics, and aerodynamic parts that are mapped using about 200 sensors. Depending on the length of a circuit, on an average,
F1 cars generate around 3TB of data over a race weekend, stored, processed,and used for further real-time performance analytics.

One of the major components for winning an F1 race is optimizing the car design. Constructors rely heavily upon data for optimising their design.
For every race, huge data is generated and analysed for driver and design performance. Accordingly, the databases needed for storing such a huge 
amount of data must be fast and efficient.A typical database design for this purpose will boil down to different components that make up F1 Racing.
Data is collected for various categories, for instance, driver’s details such as full name, date of birth, nationality, driver’s jersey number, 
team’s data such as team name, drivers, car engine manufacturer, car chassis manufacturer, sponsors. On the other hand, race data is tracked in terms
of lap times, pitstops, qualifying race details, flags, race results, race schedule. Additionally, yearlong data on driver season standings,
constructor championship, and Grand Prix results are also recorded. Moreover, each financial year data for the organization such as viewership,
tickets sold, profits, sponsor data, driver’s transfer fees, team budgets are noted. This data is made public for the fans to follow teams and drivers
which ultimately enhances fans engagement.
